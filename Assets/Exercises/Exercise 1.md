### E1: Character Bobbing and Sprint Implementation

In this exercise, we will be focusing on the common mechanic of sprinting whenever the player holds down the shift key.

The two key components of this exercise are:

1. **Sprinting with Shift Key**  
   
2. **Bobbing Animation using Unity's Animator**  

### Sprinting

#### Steps:

1. **Getting Input using Shift**
    The first step will be recieving player input when shift is pressed.

2. **Modifying Movement Speed When Shift is Pressed**
    Ensure the player's speed increases while holding Shift and decreases when released. 

3. **BONUS: Smooth the transition between walking and running**   
    For an extra challenge, you can look into the built-in Lerp method in Unity to smooth acceleration and deceleration movement.

### Bobbing Animation
#### Steps:

1. **Make a Sprint Animation**
    Repeat the steps you took to make your orignal animation, just make it faster.

2. **Add a State for Sprinting**
    Add a state to your animation graph for your sprint animation.

3. **Transition to Your Sprinting State**
    Make your character animate faster while sprinting.
